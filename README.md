# Hand-Gestured-Virtual-Controllers
This repository is made by Sahil Gupta and i provided my 4th semester B.Tech project as an open-source project so that any student in the future can use this repository to make Hand Gestured Virtual Keyboard, Mouse and Volume controller using python.

In this repository there are 5 python files but if anyone wants to run:
virtual keyboard, then he/she should run the virtualkeboard.py
virtual mouse, then he/she should run the mouse.py
volume controller, then he/she should run the Gesture_Volume_Control.py

BE HAPPY AND STAY POSITIVE...
